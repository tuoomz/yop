# YOP EVM Smart Contracts V2 Changelogs

## Features

- Allow users to boost their APY using staking
  - Details can be found in [this ADR](../docs/ADRs/2022-03-22-boosted-apy.md)
  - The following new versions of smart contracts are added to support this feature
    - [SingleAssetVaultV2.sol](../contracts/vaults/SingleAssetVaultV2.sol)
      - The size of this contract is over the limit, so we moved some of the stateless functions in to an external [library](../contracts/libraries/VaultUtils.sol) to reduce the size.
    - [YOPRewardsV2.sol](../contracts/rewards/YOPRewardsV2.sol)
    - [StakingV2.sol](../contracts/staking/StakingV2.sol)
- New Curve/Convex strategies to support any Curve/Convex pools
  - The previous versions have hardcoded Curve/Convex pool information in the contracts, which means it's difficult to support a different Curve/Convex pool if we want.
  - The new versions allow pass in the Curve/Convex pool information via constructor parameters, so it will be easy to support a different Curve/Convex pool
  - New versions of the strategies can be found in the following directories:
    - [curvev2](../contracts/strategies/curvev2/)
    - [convexv2](../contracts/strategies/convexv2/)
- New router contract to allow users to do swap and stake, or swap and deposit in a single transaction. This will simplify the process for users to use our platform if they don't already have the tokens that our platform support.
  - See [YOPRouter.sol](../contracts/router/YOPRouter.sol)
  - As part of this, we also added a [YOPRegistry.sol](../contracts/registry/YOPRegistry.sol) as a central registry for look up YOP Vault addresses.
- New access control policy to allow us to check if a wallet is on the Chainlysis's sanction list.
  - See [SanctionsListAccessControl.sol](../contracts/access/SanctionsListAccessControl.sol)

## Enhancements

- [Staking.sol](../contracts/staking/Staking.sol)
  - Automatically claim the rewards of a stake when it is unstaked
- [StakingV2.sol](../contracts/staking/StakingV2.sol)
  - Added support for extending a stake
  - Added support for "compounding" rewards - claim the stake/vault rewards and add them to existing stakes in a gas efficient way
- [YOPRewards.sol](../contracts/rewards/YOPRewards.sol)
  - Made a few improvements to reduce gas costs, including:
    - Store current epoch information and reuse it if possible to avoid re-calculating it every time
    - Avoid re-calculating pool state in the same block if it has been done already
    - Avoid updating storage data if new data is the same as the existing one
